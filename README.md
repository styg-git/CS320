# CS320 - Software Automation and Testing

**How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?**

To ensure my software is both functional and secure, I focus on testing, validation, and security best practices. I write parameterized unit tests to maximize code coverage efficiently while reducing manual test writing. Regular code reviews, static analysis tools, and dependency checks help catch vulnerabilities early. By incorporating continuous integration and automated security testing, I can proactively address issues and maintain software reliability.

**How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?**

Interpreting user needs begins with a thorough understanding of requirements gathering. Without clearly defined requirements, building effective software is impossible. Once requirements are defined, I translate them into user stories, workflows, and technical specifications, ensuring alignment with business goals. Throughout development, I validate assumptions with iterative testing, refining the program to best fit user needs.

**How do I approach designing software?**

To approach designing software, I follow a structured process that includes planning, understanding requirements, and iterating based on feedback or in the case of personal projects, my own results. Understanding the problem you're trying to solve is the most logical first step. Then, I critically think and begin researching methods for solving the problem before outlining my approach in pseudocode or a flowchart (usually handwritten). Once I've done that, I open documentation around what it is I'm trying to code to ensure 100% accuracy and I start piecing things together.
